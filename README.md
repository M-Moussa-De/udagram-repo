# Udagram

It's the third project on the advanced web development track on the Udacity platform. We should host and deploy a full stack project and automate the process using CircleCi.

Having a look at the docs' folder, should give you a better understanding for the dependencies, project's infrastructure and the pipeline. As well don't forget to check the diagrams to get a visualised image of what it's happening.
